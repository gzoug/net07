After adding new exercises in 'exercises' folder, you should invoke the QuestionBuilder 
in order to create the proper 'xx-ids.xml' and 'xx-distribution.xml' files

QuestionBuilder MUST NOT BE EXECUTED on exercises whose session has been activated and/or
you have collected answers for them. Doing so, you will end up having different question 
IDs generated - thus previous commited answers will be unlinked to their questions. 
Check at the end of the document for more...

On activated/past sessions, you should edit only the 'xx-ids.xml' file
##################################################################################

How To: 

bin/net07-QuestionBuilder.bat exercises/01.xml

This will build 01-ids.xml, 01-distribution.xml and 01-distribution.enc files into the same folder 01.xml exists.

Then 
1: Copy 01-distribution.xml (or .enc) into src/data folder (this is the questions file without the correct answer)
2: Make appropriate changes to the src/data/configuration.xml file to include those files. Define DUE datetimes
   If you have included .enc files, change the configuration.xml file, setting the apropriate 'encoded' attribute to TRUE
3: Copy 01-ids.xml into src/org/exadmin/data folder - This will be needed for grading answers


Changing the content of already distributed exercises
-----------------------------------------------------

Regenerations over the input files, will generated IDs only for questions having NO ID defined.
Thus, after each regeneration of your questions, it is wise to replace the input xx.xml file with the generated xx-ids.xml 
Then, when you need to correct an already distributed question you can modify ONLY the text or the correct answer and Regenerate. 

[initial file] --> QuestionBuilder -> [xx-ids.xml]          --> copy over [initial file] .... [modified initial file] --> QuestionBuilder...
                                      [xx-distributed.xml]
                                      [xx-distributed.enc]



Whenever there is a modofication in questions list, you should rebuild and redistribute the jar package!
